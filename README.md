# StringBuilder
a stirng builder for the c language


This is a very simple and effective string builder in c, using a linked
list of char * (char [255]) and appending the strings with list,
instead of growing the array saves time, but might use more memory
(time vs. memory).

TODO:
*   write test code
*   time complexity
*   more optimization
*   check for memory leaks?
*   clean out code base
